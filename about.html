                        Hello all! My name is Devin Ennis, and I am a full-stack software developer/designer for Nationwide Financial. 
                        I spent 4 years at the University of Louisville to earn a bachelors degree in Computer Information Systems, with a focus on business process management. 
                        While I am passionate about developing front-end software, I am also intrigued by how we can leverage technology in order to improve business processes and efficiency as a whole.

                            In my free time, I enjoy developing software through side-projects, being outdoors, working out, and playing basketball. My mother, Rhonda, is my biggest supporter and also my best-friend. I would not be the man I am today if it wasn't for her.
